# Frequency Response and Fourier Transform

## Quick Notes on Damping
### Underdamped, Critically damped, and Overdamped 
Underdamped: imgarinary poles

Cirtically damped: repeated poles (eigenvalues)

Overdamped: Real eigenvalues

For a standard second-order transfer function:

$$
G(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2}
$$

For a standard second-order system:

$$
\ddot{y}(t) + 2\zeta \omega_n \dot{y}(t) + \omega_n^2 y(t) = K \omega_n^2 u(t)
$$

---

The standard second-order system in differential equation form is:

$$
\ddot{y}(t) + 2\zeta \omega_n \dot{y}(t) + \omega_n^2 y(t) = K \omega_n^2 u(t)
$$



**1. Underdamped** ($$0 < \zeta < 1$$):

$$
y(t) = e^{-\zeta \omega_n t} \left[ A \cos\left( \omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2} \, t \right) 
+ B \sin\left( \omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2} \, t \right) \right]
$$



**Critically damped** ($$\zeta = 1$$):

$$
y(t) = \left( A + Bt \right) e^{-\omega_n t}
$$



**Overdamped** ($$\zeta > 1$$):

Let:
$$
r_{1,2} = -\omega_n \left( \zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1} \right)
$$

Then:
$$
y(t) = A e^{r_1 t} + B e^{r_2 t}
$$


### Damping in higher order systems
Damping behavior is only defined for second order systems. Dominant poles are investigated for general behavior for higher-order systems.
### Damping and Bode plot
A peak in the frequency response (magnitude plot) happens when the system has complex conjugate poles that are **lightly damped**.

## Fourier and Laplace Transforms

**Note:** In Laplace domain, $$s=\sigma + j\omega$$. When evaluating Laplace Transform at $$s=j\omega$$, Laplace Transform becomes Fourier Transform. **when you go from the Laplace transform $$F(s)$$ to the Fourier transform $$F(j\omega)$$, youâ€™re essentially looking at the steady-state sinusoidal response of the system.**

### Laplace Transform
$$
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \, dt
$$

Laplace Tranform is a generialized form of Fourier Transform. Specifically, Fourier Transform evaluates Laplace Transform at $$i\omega$$, with no real parts, ie. Fourier Transform only evaluates purely imaginary arguments for Laplace Transform.
**Inpoulse response** h(t) given $$u = \delta(t)$$ is $$L^{-1}{G(s), where Y(s) = G(s)X(s)}$$ ie the inverse Laplace Transform of the Transfer function (G(s))
### Fourier Series

If $$f(t)$$ is a periodic function with period $T$, its **Fourier series** representation is:

$$
f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}\right) \right]
$$

The coefficients are given by:

$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \, dt
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}\right) dt
$$

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}\right) dt
$$

You can also write the Fourier series using **complex exponentials**:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{i 2\pi n t / T}
$$

with coefficients:

$$
c_n = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) e^{-i 2\pi n t / T} dt
$$

### Fourier Transform

For non-periodic functions, the **Fourier Transform** is used. The **continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT)** of a function $f(t)$ is:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} dt
$$

The **inverse Fourier transform** is:

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i \omega t} d\omega
$$

Alternatively, in terms of frequency $$f$$ (Hz) instead of angular frequency $\omega = 2\pi f$:

$$
F(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i 2\pi f t} dt
$$

$$
f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(f) e^{i 2\pi f t} df
$$

**Intuition** Fourier Transform converts a time-domain $$\bar{x}(t)$$ to frequency domain $$X(f)$$. This investigates how much of this specific frequency exists in the signal.
Fourier Transform returns a complex number.
1. The magnitude of this number denotes how strong that frequency is in the signal
2. The angle of the complex number signifies the phase offset of that frequency - i.e., where that sine wave starts relative to time zero.

## Non-minimum Phase

**Motivation**: For the same magnitude gain plot, phase plots can be drastically different. This is due to the fact that multiple transfer functions can produce the same magnitude gain plot, but have different phase profiles.

**Note**: Non-miminum phase can be primarily caused by three phenomena: 1. Time delay $$e^{-sT}$$ 2. RHP zeroes 3. Non-causal/Inverse-unstable Dynamics (Non-causal systems depend on input in the future)

Inverse-unstable systems (RHP in zero -> inverse system has RHP pole (unstable inverse))

## Bode and Nyquist Plots

### Frequency Response

$$ frac{\bar{x}}{\bar{u}}$$
**Notes:** 
1. The bode plots are plotted in log scale. A small bump in Gain plot corresponds to huge response at resonate frequency. 
2. At extremely low frequency, this system displays no gain at all hence Gain = 0 for low frequencies. At high frequencies, the sytems doesn't have the capacity to respond in times hence the gain drops asymptotically to zero or $-\infty$ in log scale.
