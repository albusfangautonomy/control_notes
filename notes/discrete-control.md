# Discrete-Time Control

## Continuous vs Discrete Time domain (Analog vs Digital)
1. Quatization Error would be introduced and can be minimized. There is a trade-off between bits, measurement range and quatization error 
2. Discrete time (digital) systems introduce delay, which introduces lag and reduces bandwidth of controller.

## Z doman and Z transform
