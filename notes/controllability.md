# Equivalence
1. System is controllable
2. Arbitrary Eigenvalue (Pole) placement is allowed
    - $$u = -Kx \Rightarrow \dot{x} = (A-BK)x$$ 
3. Reachability (full in $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$)
    - Theoretically one can drive from Massachusetts to California in a second
    - This can be proven by Cayley-Hamilton theorem

## Cayley-Hamilton Theorem
Almost every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation

The characteristic polynomial of matrix $$A$$ is defined as:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I_n - A)
$$
Since this is a degree-$$n$$ monic polynomial, it can be written as:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \lambda^n + c_{n-1} \lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 \lambda + c_0
$$
By replacing the scalar variable $$\lambda$$ with the matrix $$A$$, we define the matrix polynomial:
$$
p_A(A) = A^n + c_{n-1} A^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 A + c_0 I_n
$$

# Controllability

## Stabilizability

Controllability for a large dimension space may be too extreme and sometimes unrealistic. For this purpose, stabilizability is defined as:

**Stabilizability**  
A system is stabilizable if and only if all unstable (or lightly damped) eigenvectors of A are in controllable subspace. (Anything unstable can be damped)

Actuator B should be designed so that the unstable dynamic directions correspond to the big singular vector of the controllability matrix.


### Examples of Stabilizability

1. Inverted Pendulum on a cart
    - **Unstable Mode**: the pendulum tipping over (angle grows exponentially).
    - **Why Stabilizable**:
        - The cart can move left or right, providing a restoring torque - can be damped.

2. Rocket During Takeoff
    - **Unstable Mode**: pitch/roll drift - if thrust isn't perfectly aligned, rocket tips and diverges.
    - **Why Stabilizable**:
        - Thrust vector control changes the direction of the force relative to the center of mass. This gives direct control authority over the unstable angular dynamics.

3. Drone in hover (quadcopter)
    - **Unstable Mode**: attitude - if it tilts slightly, gravity pulls it further, the drone accelerates away.
    - **Why stabilizable**:
        - Each rotor produces torque about pitch, roll, and yaw.
        - These torques directly act on the unstable angular states.
        - Feedback (from IMU + controllers) lets you push those unstable poles into the stable LHP

## Controllability of Linear system
$$\dot{x}=Ax+Bu$$
$$y=Cx$$  
This system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $$C=[B\ AB\ A^2B\ ...\ A^{n-1}B]$$ is of full column rank

**Note**: This is a binary check. To see how controllable this system is, investigate the SVD of C.

## Degrees of Controllability
The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the controllability matrix provides deep insight into the degree and direction of controllability of a linear system:
1. Controllability Rank  
    If $$C$$ has full rank (i.e. rank = number of states $$n$$), the system is completely controllable.

    The number of nonzero singular values = the rank of $$C$$.

2. Strength of Controllability (Conditioning)  
    The magnitude of the singular values tells you how "strongly" controllable the system is in different directions:

    Large singular values ‚Üí easy to move the system in that direction.  
    Tiny singular values ‚Üí very difficult to control (require large input energy).  
    Zero singular values ‚Üí system not controllable in that direction.

3. Controllable Directions  
    The right singular vectors $$V$$ from $$C = U \Sigma V^\top$$ span the input space.  
    The left singular vectors $$U$$ represent orthogonal directions in the state space.  

    Directions associated with large singular values in $$U$$ are the most controllable.

## Controllability Gramian
**The eigenvectors of the Gramian ($$W_t$$) that correspond to the biggest eigenvalues are the most controllable directions in state space. This is the same as the first column vector of the U matrix of the SVD of controllability matrix**

$$W_{t} \approx CC^T$$  
The determinant of the Gramian indicates the volume of the ellipsoid and the **signal-to-noise ratio**.

The **controllability Gramian** is a matrix that quantifies how easily a system‚Äôs state can be driven by the input. It measures the **energy** required to move the system from the origin to a particular state.

### üîß System Setup

For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)
$$

The **finite-horizon controllability Gramian** over the time interval $$[0, T]$$ is:

$$
W_c(T) = \int_0^T e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau
$$

If $$A$$ is stable and $$T \to \infty$$, the **infinite-horizon controllability Gramian** is:

$$
W_c = \int_0^\infty e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau
$$

### üìå What the Gramian Tells You

#### ‚úÖ 1. Controllability Test

- The system is **controllable** if and only if $$ W_c $$ is **positive definite**.
- If $$ W_c $$ is singular (has zero eigenvalues), some states cannot be reached from the origin.

#### ‚ö° 2. Energy to Reach a State

The **minimum energy** to reach a state $$ x_f $$ from the origin is:

$$
E = x_f^\top W_c^{-1} x_f
$$

States in directions with **small eigenvalues** of $$W_c$$ require **more energy** to reach.

#### üìê 3. Geometric Interpretation

The ellipsoid:

$$
\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x^\top W_c^{-1} x \leq 1 \right\}
$$

describes the set of states reachable with **unit energy**. This is known as the **reachable ellipsoid**.

#### üéØ 4. Mode-wise Controllability

If $$ W_c $$ has a mix of **large** and **small** eigenvalues, then **some state directions are harder to control** than others.

**Notes**  
1. The controllability Gramian is only defined for **linear** systems and often assumes zero initial state.  
2. The controllability Gramian is symmetric and positive semi-definite.

## PBH Test
(A,B) is controllable if and only if
$$
\text{rank}[(A-\lambda I)\ B] = n \quad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C}
$$
1. $$\text{rank}(A-\lambda I)=n$$ except for eigenvalues $$\lambda$$
2. B needs to have some component in each eigenvector direction
3. (Advanced) A random vector B would make (A,B) controllable with high probability

## Reachability
In control theory, **reachability** describes whether it is possible to move a system from an initial state to a desired final state using admissible control inputs over a finite time interval.

For a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)
$$

where:
- $$x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ is the state vector,
- $$u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$$ is the control input,
- $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ is the system matrix,
- $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$ is the input matrix,

the system is **reachable** if, for any initial state $$x(0)$$ and any final state $$x_f$$, there exists an input $$u(t)$$ that drives the system from $$x(0)$$ to $$x_f$$ in finite time.

---

### Reachability Matrix

The reachability of the system can be tested using the **reachability matrix**:

$$
\mathcal{R} = \begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \cdots & A^{n-1}B \end{bmatrix}
$$

If $$\mathcal{R}$$ has **full rank** (i.e., $$\text{rank}(\mathcal{R}) = n$$), then the system is reachable.

### üéØ Reachability Set

The **reachability set** (or reachable set) at time $$t_f$$ is the set of all states that the system can reach from an initial state $$x(0)$$ under some admissible input $$u(t)$$ over the time interval $$[0, t_f]$$.

Formally, for a continuous-time LTI system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t), \quad x(0) = 0
$$

the **reachability set** at time $$t_f$$ is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{R}(t_f) = \left\{ x(t_f) \in \mathbb{R}^n \;\middle|\; x(t_f) = \int_0^{t_f} e^{A(t_f - \tau)} B u(\tau) \, d\tau,\; u(\cdot) \in \mathcal{L}^2[0, t_f] \right\}
$$

This set contains all possible states the system can reach at time $$t_f$$ from the origin with square-integrable inputs $$u(t)$$.

If $$\mathcal{R}(t_f)$$ spans $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ for some finite $$t_f$$, the system is reachable.

For discrete-time systems:

$$
x[k+1] = A x[k] + B u[k], \quad x[0] = 0
$$

the reachability set after $$N$$ steps is:

$$
\mathcal{R}_d(N) = \left\{ x[N] = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A^i B u[N-1-i] \;\middle|\; u[i] \in \mathbb{R}^m \right\}
$$

The union of all such sets over all $$t_f$$ (or $$N$$ in discrete time) is the **total reachable set** from the origin.
