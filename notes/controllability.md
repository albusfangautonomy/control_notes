# Equivalence
1. System is controllable
2. Arbitrary Eigenvalue (Pole) placement is allowed
    - $$u = -Kx => \dot{x} = (A-BK)x$$ 
3. Reachability (full in R^{n})
    - Theorectically one can drive from Massachusetts to California in a second
    - This can be proven by Cayley-Hamilton theorem

## Cayley-Hamilton Theorem
Almost every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation

The characteristic polynomial of matrix $$A$$ is defined as:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I_n - A)
$$
Since this is a degree-$$n$$ monic polynomial, it can be written as:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \lambda^n + c_{n-1} \lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 \lambda + c_0
$$
By replacing the scalar variable $$\lambda$$ with the matrix $$A$$, we define the matrix polynomial:
$$
p_A(A) = A^n + c_{n-1} A^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 A + c_0 I_n
$$

# Controllability

## Stabilizability

Controllability for a large dimension space maybe too extreme and sometimes unrealistic. For this purpose, Stabilizability is defined as

**Stabilizability**
A system is stabilizable if and only if all unstable (or lightly damped) eigenvectors of A are in controlable subspace. (Anything unstable can be damped)

Actuator B should be designed so that the unstable dynamic direcitons correspond to the big singular vector of the controlability matrix.

## Controllability of Linear system
$$\dot{x}=Ax+Bu$$
$$y=Cx$$
This system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $$C=[B\ AB\ A^2B\ ...\ A^{n-1}B]$$ is of full column rank

**Note** This is a binary check. To see how controllable this system is, investigate the SVD of C.

## Degrees of Controllability
The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the controllability matrix provides deep insight into the degree and direction of controllability of a linear system:
1. Controllability Rank
    If 𝐶 has full rank (i.e. rank = number of states 𝑛), the system is completely controllable.

    The number of nonzero singular values = the rank of 𝐶.

2. Strength of Controllability (Conditioning)
    The magnitude of the singular values tells you how "strongly" controllable the system is in different directions:

    Large singular values → easy to move the system in that direction.

    Tiny singular values → very difficult to control (require large input energy).

    Zero singular values → system not controllable in that direction.

3. Controllable Directions
    The right singular vectors V from $$𝐶 = 𝑈Σ𝑉^𝑇$$ span the input space.

    The left singular vectors 𝑈 represent orthogonal directions in the state space.

    Directions associated with large singular values in 𝑈 are the most controllable.

## Controllability Gramian
**The eigenvectors of the Gramian ($$W_t$$) that correspond to the biggest eigenvalues are the most controllable directions in state space. This is the same as the first column vector of the U matrix of the SVD of controllability matrix**

$$W_{t} \approx CC^T$$
The determinant of the Gramian indicates the volume of the ellipsoid and the **signal to noise ratio**

The **controllability Gramian** is a matrix that quantifies how easily a system’s state can be driven by the input. It measures the **energy** required to move the system from the origin to a particular state.

### 🔧 System Setup

For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)
$$

The **finite-horizon controllability Gramian** over the time interval $$[0, T]$$ is:

$$
W_c(T) = \int_0^T e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau
$$

If \(A\) is stable and $$T \to \infty$$, the **infinite-horizon controllability Gramian** is:

$$
W_c = \int_0^\infty e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau
$$

---

### 📌 What the Gramian Tells You

#### ✅ 1. Controllability Test

- The system is **controllable** if and only if $$ W_c $$ is **positive definite**.
- If $$ W_c $$ is singular (has zero eigenvalues), some states cannot be reached from the origin.

#### ⚡ 2. Energy to Reach a State

The **minimum energy** to reach a state \( x_f \) from the origin is:

$$
E = x_f^\top W_c^{-1} x_f
$$

States in directions with **small eigenvalues** of \(W_c\) require **more energy** to reach.

#### 📐 3. Geometric Interpretation

The ellipsoid:

$$
\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x^\top W_c^{-1} x \leq 1 \right\}
$$

describes the set of states reachable with **unit energy**. This is known as the **reachable ellipsoid**.

#### 🎯 4. Mode-wise Controllability

If $$ W_c $$ has a mix of **large** and **small** eigenvalues, then **some state directions are harder to control** than others.

**Notes**
1. The controllability Gramian is only defined for **linear** systems and often assumes zero initial state.
2. The controllability Gramian is symmetric and positive semi-definite

## PBH Test
(A,B) is controllable if and only if
$$
rank[(A-\lambda I)\ B] = n \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C}
$$
1. $$rank(A-\lambda I)=n$$ except for eigenvalues $$\lambda$$
2. B needs to have some component in each eigenvector directions
3. (Advanced) a random vector B would make (A,B) controllably with high probability

## Reachability
In control theory, **reachability** describes whether it is possible to move a system from an initial state to a desired final state using admissible control inputs over a finite time interval.

For a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)
$$

where:
- $$x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ is the state vector,
- $$u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$$ is the control input,
- $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ is the system matrix,
- $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$ is the input matrix,

the system is **reachable** if, for any initial state $$x(0)$$ and any final state $$x_f$$, there exists an input $$u(t)$$ that drives the system from $$x(0)$$ to $$x_f$$ in finite time.

### Reachability Matrix

The reachability of the system can be tested using the **reachability matrix**:

$$
\mathcal{R} = \begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \cdots & A^{n-1}B \end{bmatrix}
$$

If $$\mathcal{R}$$ has **full rank** (i.e., $$\text{rank}(\mathcal{R}) = n$$), then the system is reachable
### 🎯 Reachability Set

The **reachability set** (or reachable set) at time $$t_f$$ is the set of all states that the system can reach from an initial state $$x(0)$$ under some admissible input $$u(t)$$ over the time interval $$[0, t_f]$$.

Formally, for a continuous-time LTI system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t), \quad x(0) = 0
$$

the **reachability set** at time $$t_f$$ is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{R}(t_f) = \left\{ x(t_f) \in \mathbb{R}^n \;\middle|\; x(t_f) = \int_0^{t_f} e^{A(t_f - \tau)} B u(\tau) \, d\tau,\; u(\cdot) \in \mathcal{L}^2[0, t_f] \right\}
$$

This set contains all possible states the system can reach at time $$t_f$$ from the origin with square-integrable inputs $$u(t)$$.

If $$\mathcal{R}(t_f)$$ spans $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ for some finite $$t_f$$, the system is reachable.

For discrete-time systems:

$$
x[k+1] = A x[k] + B u[k], \quad x[0] = 0
$$

the reachability set after $$N$$ steps is:

$$
\mathcal{R}_d(N) = \left\{ x[N] = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A^i B u[N-1-i] \;\middle|\; u[i] \in \mathbb{R}^m \right\}
$$

The union of all such sets over all $$t_f$$ (or $$N$$ in discrete time) is the **total reachable set** from the origin.
