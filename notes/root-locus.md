# Root Locus Analysis
## Poles and Zeros
1. The stability of an LTI system depends solely on the poles of its transfer function, including stability, speed of decay/growth, or natural oscillaitons.
2. Zeros (roots of the numerator) don’t directly affect stability because they don’t appear in the characteristic equation that governs the natural modes of the system.

### What do Zeros do?

1. Transient Shape and Overshoot
    - Zeros can introduce additional terms in the time response that can increase or decrease overshoot, depending on their location.
    - A zero close to the origin (s = 0) or near the imaginary axis can significantly change the transient waveform.

2. Direction and Phase
    - Zeros affect the phase of the frequency response.

3. Magnitude Shaping
    - Zeros can boost or attenuate specific frequency components, affecting bandwidth and disturbance rejection.
