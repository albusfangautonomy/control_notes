# üß† Control Notes

Welcome to my personal collection of control systems notes. This site compiles essential topics, explanations, and formulas for quick reference and deeper learning.

## üìö Core Topics
- [Open-loop vs Close-loop control](./notes/openclose.md)
  A comparison between Open Loop control and Closed Loop control

- [PID Control](./notes/pid.md)  
  Overview of Proportional-Integral-Derivative control, tuning methods, use cases.

- [Lead, Lag, and Lead-Lag Compensators](./notes/compensators.md)  
  Frequency domain intuition, Bode plot effects, stability and performance improvement.

- [Root Locus Analysis](./notes/root-locus.md)  
  Pole-zero placement and visualizing the impact of controller design.

- [Optimal Pole Placement in Linear Systems](./notes/pole_placement.md)
  Introduces LQR and pole placement

- [LQE](./notes/state_estim.md)
  Linear quadratic Estimator and Observability.

- [Controllability and Reachability](./notes/controllability.md)
  Illustrates the equivalence between controllability and reachability.

- [Frequency Analysis and Fourier Transform](./notes/frequency-response.md)  
  How to interpret system behavior in the frequency domain, including Fourier Transform and Bode Plots.

- [State Space Representation](./notes/state-space.md)  
  Modern control approach using states, matrices, and observability/controllability.

- [Stability Analysis](./notes/stability.md)  
  Routh-Hurwitz, Nyquist, Lyapunov methods and practical insights.

- [Discrete-Time Control](./notes/discrete-control.md)  
  Z-transform, digital implementation of controllers, sampling effects.

- [Model Predictive Control (MPC)](./notes/mpc.md)  
  Optimization-based control for constrained systems (intro-level overview).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques

- [Control System Design Workflow](./notes/workflow.html)  
  From modeling to simulation to real-world tuning.

- [Control Using Simulink & Python](./notes/tools.html)  
  Practical guides using Simulink, Python (`control`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
