# Limit Cycles
Rather than fixed point stabilization in linear systems control. Walking primarily deals with the limit cycle stability. One of the most famous limit cycle is the *Van der Pol oscillator*. Limit Cycle stability is determined by using **Poincare maps**, which turns the limit cycle stability problem into a fix point stability problem.

# Contact Models
1. Models the ground as a stiff spring, when foot makes contact.
    - this can cause large gradients and make the simulation blow up.

2. Rigit contact - the foot never penetrates the ground.
    - Impulse force that instantaneously stops the foot.
