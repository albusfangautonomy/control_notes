Intuition . | Z transform calculates the correlation between the time domain signal and combinations of both sinusoids and exponentials, which solves most linear shift invariant systems. | Unlike DTFT, Z transform has convergence problems . | For instance, for infinite discrete time signal, when there’s no frequency profile, when the probing signal grows at the same rate at which time signal decays, the sum goes to infinity. (See figure below) Even though all subsequent smaller r would also make the sum \\(\\infty\\), the first instance when the sum does not converge is when a perfect correlation has been found. A pole exists here. | For a finite discrete time signal, the sum for z transform always converges. We therefore cannot investigate finite time signals with Z transform without an assumption (signal = 0 for rest of time). In such a case DTFT is useful. | . | . ",

    "content": ". Z domain is the discrete counterpart of the Laplace S domain. However, Z-domain is not a straight discretization of the S-domain, rather Z domain maps S-domain into a unit circle in polar coordinates as explained below. Z Plane and S Plane . Z plane is in polar coordinates, while S plane is in Cartesian coordinates. Since \\(z = r*e^{i \\omega} = e^{sT} = e^{\\sigma + i \\omega T}\\), the real part \\(e^{\\sigma T}\\) scales the circle. The black line enclosing the unit circle and separates the inside and outside of the circle in the Z plane corresponds to the Imaginary axis in the S plane. \\(e^{i \\omega T}\\) traces a circle. For a continuous domain, there are infinite frequencies so S plane goes from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\). However, in discrete systems, frequency only goes from \\([-f_{nyquist}, f_{nyquist}]\\) on the imaginary axis (real axis on S plane still goes to infinity). \\[f_{nyquist} = f_{sampling} / 2\\] Since frequency is represented by the angle between a line and positive x-axis on the Z plane, Nyquist frequency represents the . Defining \\(z = e^{sT}\\) makes implementing physical hardware easy, since inverse Z transform to difference equation is trivial. This is due to the fact that \\(z^{-1}\\) corresponds to a single time step delay in time domain for the difference equation. Note the coefficients of the difference equation correspond to those in the transfer function. This makes the inverse Z transform trivial. ",

This method ensures the discrete impulse is the same as the continuous impulse response. Note that Matlab defines impulse differently than Kronecker delta and is scaled by \\(T_s\\).

    "content": "Note: In Laplace domain, \\(s=\\sigma + j\\omega\\). When evaluating Laplace Transform at \\(s=j\\omega\\), Laplace Transform becomes Fourier Transform. when you go from the Laplace transform \\(F(s)\\) to the Fourier transform \\(F(j\\omega)\\), you’re essentially looking at the steady-state sinusoidal response of the system. Laplace Transform . \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\\) . Laplace Tranform is a generialized form of Fourier Transform. Specifically, Fourier Transform evaluates Laplace Transform at \\(i\\omega\\), with no real parts, ie. Fourier Transform only evaluates purely imaginary arguments for Laplace Transform. Inpoulse response h(t) given \\(u = \\delta(t)\\) is \\(L^{-1}{G(s), where Y(s) = G(s)X(s)}\\) ie the inverse Laplace Transform of the Transfer function (G(s)) . Fourier Series . If \\(f(t)\\) is a periodic function with period $T$, its Fourier series representation is: . \\[f(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n t}{T}\\right) + b_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n t}{T}\\right) \\right]\\] The coefficients are given by: . \\[a_0 = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \\, dt\\] \\[a_n = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n t}{T}\\right) dt\\] \\[b_n = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n t}{T}\\right) dt\\] You can also write the Fourier series using complex exponentials: . \\[f(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{i 2\\pi n t / T}\\] with coefficients: . \\[c_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(t) e^{-i 2\\pi n t / T} dt\\] . Fourier Transform . For non-periodic functions, the Fourier Transform is used. The continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a function $f(t)$ is: . \\[F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i \\omega t} dt\\] The inverse Fourier transform is: . \\[f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(\\omega) e^{i \\omega t} d\\omega\\] Alternatively, in terms of frequency \\(f\\) (Hz) instead of angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$: . \\[F(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i 2\\pi f t} dt\\] \\[f(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(f) e^{i 2\\pi f t} df\\] Intuition Fourier Transform converts a time-domain \\(\\bar{x}(t)\\) to frequency domain \\(X(f)\\). This investigates how much of this specific frequency exists in the signal. Fourier Transform returns a complex number. | The magnitude of this number denotes how strong that frequency is in the signal | The angle of the complex number signifies the phase offset of that frequency - i.e., where that sine wave starts relative to time zero. | .

Important Notes on Nyquist Plot . | If the open loop system is stable (ie. \\(L(s)\\) doesn’t have any RHP poles), Nyquist plot should not encircle -1 and if it does, it means the closed loop system is unstable. | If the open loop system is unstable (ie. there are RHP poles), Nyquist plot needs to encircle the -1 point \\(N = Z - P\\) times clockwise. This way the closed loop system is stable and the open loop system is called stabilizable. | For a strictly proper or non-strictly proper transfer function, all infinite points not on the imaginary axis on the S-plane are mapped to one single point on the W-plane | For strictly proper systems, that point is the origin. | For nonstrictly proper systems, that point is a non-zero constant with no phase ie the point lies on the positive x-axis. | .

Nyquist Plot Critical Point . Avoid (-1,0) on Nyquist plot if the system is open-loop stable. Closed-loop system oscillates at that point (marginally stable). Nyquist Plot Intuition . Nyquist plot is the plot in the W-plane resulting from a transfer function mapping the Nyquist contour on the S-plane to a plot on the W plane. In the S-plane, for proper and strictly proper transfer functions all RHP infinite points (not on the imaginary axis) are mapped to a single point in W-plane since in W-plane . \\[\\text{Phasor Magnitude} \\propto \\frac{\\Pi \\text{magnitude of zero phasors in s}}{\\Pi \\text{magnitude of pole phasors in s}}\\] . | For a strictly proper transfer function (number of zeros &lt; number of poles), this point is the origin. | For a proper transfer function (number of zeros = number of poles), this point is a non-zero constant real value. | . Plotting Nyquist plot by hand . Step 1: Substituting \\(s=j \\omega\\) into the give transfer function. Step 2: Sweep \\(\\omega\\) from 0 to \\(\\infty\\).

The IMU provides fast gyroscope and accelerometer updates; gyros give smooth angular rate but drift over time, while accelerometers are noisy but drift-free.

For a ground vehicle, I might also constrain motion with wheel odometry or nonholonomic constraints to reduce drift.

Connect each zero with the pole/zero of interest, the angle between that line and positive x axis is \\(\\psi_z\\) . A root refers to a closed-loop pole of the system for a particular value of the gain K. Rule 1: There are n lines (loci), where \\(n = max(deg(Q), deg(P))\\) . Rule 2: As K increases from 0 to \\(\\infty\\), the closed loop poles move from the poles of open loop \\(G(s)\\) to the zeroes of open loop \\(G(s)\\) - if there are same number of poles and zeroes, they form a pair the roots travel from one pole to a zero. - if there are more Poles than Zeroes, the lines from the extra poles go to \\(\\infty\\) - if there are more Zeroes than Poles, the lines come from infinity to the extra zeroes . Rule 3: When roots are complex, they occur in conjugate pairs and move together but mirrored across the real plane . Rule 4: At no time will the same root cross over its path - Paths of other roots may cross each other . Rule 5: The portion of the real axis to the left of an odd number of open loop poles and zeroes are part of the loci - Another way to restate: For K&gt;0, loci exist on the real axis to the left of odd numbered poles and zeroes . Rule 6: Lines leave and enter the real axis at \\(90^\\circ\\). Rule 7: If there are not enough poles or zeroes to make a pair then the extra lines go to (for poles) or come from (for zeroes) infinity.

If no estimates of sensor bias is available at system start, let the kalman filter converge to the correct solution while the vehicle is stationary. Note: Extended Kalman linearizes the nonlinear model at current estimate and uses the linear model to predict state into the future. If the filter is not initialized close to the true state, the linearization result would deviate and estimate would not converge. Initializing a real system . Step 2: Kalman . Predict and Correct . | Predict the state based on model and keep track of confidence (Process Noise). When new measurement comes in with measurement noise, the filter compare the measurement with predicted model and corrects its estimate based on the confidence. | If there is an update from any of the sensors, update the state based on the relative confidence based on the estimate and the measurement. | The sensor can therefore run with asyncronous measurements | . | .

Using Cauchy’s Argument Principle and Nyquist Contour . Since we need to know if there is any RHP zeros for \\(1+GH\\), we need a contour that encloses the right half plane - \\(Nyquist contour\\) on S-plane. When the Nyquist contour is mapped through a transfer function to the W-plane, we get a Nyquist plot. The Nyquist plot is plotted by pluggin in every single frequency on the imaginary axis and all the points along with infinity on the RHP in the S-plane. Instead of 1+GH, we can shift the plane to the left by -1 and only investigate the Open-loop transfer function \\(GH\\). By looking at the Nyquist plot, we can see how many times the -1 point is encircled and in which direction. Steps: . | Get Nyquist plot of Open-loop transfer function \\(G(s)H(s)\\) | Count encirclements of -1, note direction. | Determine how many more poles or zeros are in the RHP. We can do this since we typically know how many poles are in the RHP for \\(GH\\) | .

To guarantee no RHP zeros for \\(1+L(s)\\), we need to have 1 counterclockwise encirclement for every open-loop RHP pole. This prperty allows to use Nyquist plots to analyze both stable and unstable open-loop system, unlike the bode plot, which only pertains to stable open loop systems. Nyquist Criterion . Setup. Let the open-loop transfer be \\(G(s)\\) for a unity-feedback loop with closed-loop characteristic \\(1+G(s)=0\\). Let: . | \\(P\\) = number of open-loop poles of \\(G(s)\\) in the right-half plane (RHP), | \\(N\\) = number of clockwise encirclements of the Nyquist critical point \\(-1+0j\\) by the Nyquist plot of \\(G(j\\omega)\\) (standard Nyquist contour), | \\(Z\\) = number of closed-loop poles in the RHP. | . General Nyquist criterion. \\(Z = N + P.\\) The closed loop is stable iff \\(Z=0\\). Equivalently, the Nyquist plot must encircle \\(-1\\) clockwise exactly \\(N=-P\\) times. Common special case (open-loop stable, i.e., \\(P=0\\)). If \\(G(s)\\) has no RHP poles and no poles on the \\(j\\omega\\)-axis (aside from allowable integrators handled with the modified contour), then: . | Closed loop is stable iff the Nyquist plot of \\(G(j\\omega)\\) does not encircle \\(-1+0j\\) (i.e., \\(N=0 \\Rightarrow Z=0\\)). | . Bode-plot restatements (margins) . Let \\(\\omega_{gc}\\) be a gain-crossover frequency where \\(|G(j\\omega_{gc})|=1\\), and let \\(\\omega_{pc}\\) be a phase-crossover frequency where \\(\\angle G(j\\omega_{pc})=-180^\\circ\\). | Phase margin condition (at gain crossover): \\(|G(j\\omega_{gc})|=1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\angle G(j\\omega_{gc}) &gt; -180^\\circ\\) (positive phase margin). This ensures the Nyquist plot does not cross the real axis at or left of \\(-1\\). | Gain margin condition (at phase crossover): \\(\\angle G(j\\omega_{pc})=-180^\\circ \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |G(j\\omega_{pc})| &lt; 1\\) (positive gain margin). This keeps the Nyquist locus inside the unit circle when it is at \\(-180^\\circ\\), avoiding the point \\(-1\\). | . If both conditions hold for all relevant crossovers and \\(P=0\\), the loop has positive stability margins and the closed loop is stable. Notes/Caveats . | If \\(P&gt;0\\) (open-loop unstable), you must have exactly \\(N=-P\\) clockwise encirclements of \\(-1\\). Simple “margin checks” at crossovers are insufficient without accounting for \\(P\\). | Poles on the imaginary axis (e.g., pure integrators) require the standard indentation in the Nyquist contour; apply the modified criterion accordingly. | The above statements presume unity feedback; for non-unity feedback, apply the criterion to the appropriate open-loop function that multiplies the feedback path. | .
