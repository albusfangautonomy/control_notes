How would you keep the state estimate stable during that time? Which estimation technique(s) would you use and why?</h2>
<p>When GNSS drops, I’d rely on high-rate inertial data for short-term state propagation. The IMU provides fast gyroscope and accelerometer updates; gyros give smooth angular rate but drift over time, while accelerometers are noisy but drift-free. I’d use an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the IMU with any other available aiding sensors — like magnetometer for yaw reference — and explicitly model sensor biases for gyro, accel, and magnetometer in the state vector.</p>

<p>During the dropout, the EKF runs in prediction mode, essentially doing dead reckoning. For a ground vehicle, I might also constrain motion with wheel odometry or nonholonomic constraints to reduce drift. The state would include pose, velocity, accelerations, and sensor biases — about 25–30 states in my case — so when GNSS returns, the filter can quickly correct accumulated drift.</p>
