<h2 id="cayley-hamilton-theorem">Cayley-Hamilton Theorem</h2>
<p>Almost every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation</p>

<p>The characteristic polynomial of matrix \(A\) is defined as:
\(p_A(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I_n - A)\)
Since this is a degree-\(n\) monic polynomial, it can be written as:
\(p_A(\lambda) = \lambda^n + c_{n-1} \lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 \lambda + c_0\)
By replacing the scalar variable \(\lambda\) with the matrix \(A\), we define the matrix polynomial:
\(p_A(A) = A^n + c_{n-1} A^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 A + c_0 I_n\)</p>

<h1 id="controllability">Controllability</h1>

<h2 id="stabilizability">Stabilizability</h2>

<p>Controllability for a large dimension space may be too extreme and sometimes unrealistic. For this purpose, stabilizability is defined as:</p>

<p><strong>Stabilizability</strong><br />
A system is stabilizable if and only if all unstable (or lightly damped) eigenvectors of A are in controllable subspace. (Anything unstable can be damped)</p>

<p>Actuator B should be designed so that the unstable dynamic directions correspond to the big singular vector of the controllability matrix.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-stabilizability">Examples of Stabilizability</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Inverted Pendulum on a cart
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unstable Mode</strong>: the pendulum tipping over (angle grows exponentially).</li>
      <li><strong>Why Stabilizable</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>The cart can move left or right, providing a restoring torque - can be damped.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rocket During Takeoff
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unstable Mode</strong>: pitch/roll drift - if thrust isn‚Äôt perfectly aligned, rocket tips and diverges.</li>
      <li><strong>Why Stabilizable</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Thrust vector control changes the direction of the force relative to the center of mass. This gives direct control authority over the unstable angular dynamics.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drone in hover (quadcopter)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unstable Mode</strong>: attitude - if it tilts slightly, gravity pulls it further, the drone accelerates away.</li>
      <li><strong>Why stabilizable</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Each rotor produces torque about pitch, roll, and yaw.</li>
          <li>These torques directly act on the unstable angular states.</li>
          <li>Feedback (from IMU + controllers) lets you push those unstable poles into the stable LHP</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="controllability-of-linear-system">Controllability of Linear system</h2>
<p>\(\dot{x}=Ax+Bu\)
\(y=Cx\)<br />
This system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix \(C=[B\ AB\ A^2B\ ...\ A^{n-1}B]\) is of full column rank</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a binary check. To see how controllable this system is, investigate the SVD of C.</p>

<h2 id="degrees-of-controllability">Degrees of Controllability</h2>
<p>The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the controllability matrix provides deep insight into the degree and direction of controllability of a linear system:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Controllability Rank<br />
 If \(C\) has full rank (i.e. rank = number of states \(n\)), the system is completely controllable.</p>

    <p>The number of nonzero singular values = the rank of \(C\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strength of Controllability (Conditioning)<br />
 The magnitude of the singular values tells you how ‚Äústrongly‚Äù controllable the system is in different directions:</p>

    <p>Large singular values ‚Üí easy to move the system in that direction.<br />
 Tiny singular values ‚Üí very difficult to control (require large input energy).<br />
 Zero singular values ‚Üí system not controllable in that direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Controllable Directions<br />
 The right singular vectors \(V\) from \(C = U \Sigma V^\top\) span the input space.<br />
 The left singular vectors \(U\) represent orthogonal directions in the state space.</p>

    <p>Directions associated with large singular values in \(U\) are the most controllable.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="controllability-gramian">Controllability Gramian</h2>
<p><strong>The eigenvectors of the Gramian (\(W_t\)) that correspond to the biggest eigenvalues are the most controllable directions in state space. This is the same as the first column vector of the U matrix of the SVD of controllability matrix</strong></p>

<p>\(W_{t} \approx CC^T\)<br />
The determinant of the Gramian indicates the volume of the ellipsoid and the <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>controllability Gramian</strong> is a matrix that quantifies how easily a system‚Äôs state can be driven by the input. It measures the <strong>energy</strong> required to move the system from the origin to a particular state.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-system-setup">üîß System Setup</h3>

<p>For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:</p>

\[\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)\]

<p>The <strong>finite-horizon controllability Gramian</strong> over the time interval \([0, T]\) is:</p>

\[W_c(T) = \int_0^T e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau\]

<p>If \(A\) is stable and \(T \to \infty\), the <strong>infinite-horizon controllability Gramian</strong> is:</p>

\[W_c = \int_0^\infty e^{A\tau} B B^\top e^{A^\top \tau} \, d\tau\]

<h3 id="-what-the-gramian-tells-you">üìå What the Gramian Tells You</h3>

<h4 id="-1-controllability-test">‚úÖ 1. Controllability Test</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The system is <strong>controllable</strong> if and only if \(W_c\) is <strong>positive definite</strong>.</li>
  <li>If \(W_c\) is singular (has zero eigenvalues), some states cannot be reached from the origin.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-2-energy-to-reach-a-state">‚ö° 2. Energy to Reach a State</h4>

<p>The <strong>minimum energy</strong> to reach a state \(x_f\) from the origin is:</p>

\[E = x_f^\top W_c^{-1} x_f\]

<p>States in directions with <strong>small eigenvalues</strong> of \(W_c\) require <strong>more energy</strong> to reach.</p>

<h4 id="-3-geometric-interpretation">üìê 3. Geometric Interpretation</h4>

<p>The ellipsoid:</p>

\[\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x^\top W_c^{-1} x \leq 1 \right\}\]

<p>describes the set of states reachable with <strong>unit energy</strong>. This is known as the <strong>reachable ellipsoid</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="-4-mode-wise-controllability">üéØ 4. Mode-wise Controllability</h4>

<p>If \(W_c\) has a mix of <strong>large</strong> and <strong>small</strong> eigenvalues, then <strong>some state directions are harder to control</strong> than others.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The controllability Gramian is only defined for <strong>linear</strong> systems and often assumes zero initial state.</li>
  <li>The controllability Gramian is symmetric and positive semi-definite.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pbh-test">PBH Test</h2>
<p>(A,B) is controllable if and only if
\(\text{rank}[(A-\lambda I)\ B] = n \quad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C}\)</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(\text{rank}(A-\lambda I)=n\) except for eigenvalues \(\lambda\)</li>
  <li>B needs to have some component in each eigenvector direction</li>
  <li>(Advanced) A random vector B would make (A,B) controllable with high probability</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="reachability">Reachability</h2>
<p>In control theory, <strong>reachability</strong> describes whether it is possible to move a system from an initial state to a desired final state using admissible control inputs over a finite time interval.</p>

<p>For a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by:</p>

\[\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)\]

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the state vector,</li>
  <li>\(u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m\) is the control input,</li>
  <li>\(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is the system matrix,</li>
  <li>\(B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}\) is the input matrix,</li>
</ul>

<p>the system is <strong>reachable</strong> if, for any initial state \(x(0)\) and any final state \(x_f\), there exists an input \(u(t)\) that drives the system from \(x(0)\) to \(x_f\) in finite time.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="reachability-matrix">Reachability Matrix</h3>

<p>The reachability of the system can be tested using the <strong>reachability matrix</strong>:</p>

\[\mathcal{R} = \begin{bmatrix} B &amp; AB &amp; A^2B &amp; \cdots &amp; A^{n-1}B \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>If \(\mathcal{R}\) has <strong>full rank</strong> (i.e., \(\text{rank}(\mathcal{R}) = n\)), then the system is reachable.</p>

<h3 id="-reachability-set">üéØ Reachability Set</h3>

<p>The <strong>reachability set</strong> (or reachable set) at time \(t_f\) is the set of all states that the system can reach from an initial state \(x(0)\) under some admissible input \(u(t)\) over the time interval \([0, t_f]\).</p>

<p>Formally, for a continuous-time LTI system:</p>

\[\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t), \quad x(0) = 0\]

<p>the <strong>reachability set</strong> at time \(t_f\) is defined as:</p>

\[\mathcal{R}(t_f) = \left\{ x(t_f) \in \mathbb{R}^n \;\middle|\; x(t_f) = \int_0^{t_f} e^{A(t_f - \tau)} B u(\tau) \, d\tau,\; u(\cdot) \in \mathcal{L}^2[0, t_f] \right\}\]

<p>This set contains all possible states the system can reach at time \(t_f\) from the origin with square-integrable inputs \(u(t)\).</p>

<p>If \(\mathcal{R}(t_f)\) spans \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for some finite \(t_f\), the system is reachable.</p>

<p>For discrete-time systems:</p>

\[x[k+1] = A x[k] + B u[k], \quad x[0] = 0\]

<p>the reachability set after \(N\) steps is:</p>

\[\mathcal{R}_d(N) = \left\{ x[N] = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A^i B u[N-1-i] \;\middle|\; u[i] \in \mathbb{R}^m \right\}\]

<p>The union of all such sets over all \(t_f\) (or \(N\) in discrete time) is the <strong>total reachable set</strong> from the origin.</p>
