  <li>
    <p>The Gain and Phase Margins are <strong>defined with respect to open-loop transfer function</strong>, but the margins are not intrinsic properties of the open-loop system alone, and are only meaningful for the corresponding closed-loop system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Margins are local properties measured at specific crossover points. It is very possible for a higher-order system to have multiple crossover frequencies and therefore multiple Stability Margins. <strong>Conservative Rule</strong> the smallest (worst-case) margin dictates stability.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The <strong>peaks</strong> at resonance on bode plots are caused by the presence of <strong>lightly damped poles</strong>. A higher order bode plot can have multiple peaks since the system may have multiple <strong>lightly damped poles</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence of <strong>RHP zeroes</strong> make the system <strong>non-minimum phase</strong> by introducing a non-causal phase lag, which means the transient response w.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bode plot shows the <strong>steady state response only</strong> (evaluating at \(s=j\omega\)). Transient response can only be investigated in <strong>time-domain</strong> since it is a time baseed phenomenon.</p>

  <li>
    <p>An LQG controller does not have any guarantee on robustness.</p>

  <li>
    <p>LQR and LQR solves an Algebraic Riccati Equation to calculate an analytical solution to the problem given Q and R.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the system is observable, LQE can deduce all states from a few measurable states. Degrees of observability would be helpful when desining an observer.</p>

<h2 id="sensitivity-and-complementary-sensitivity-tips">Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sensitivity plots also have peaks at resonance frequencies. These peaks occur where the <strong>Open Loop Transfer Function</strong> \(L(s)\) is close to -1 in the complex plane. This often happens near the gain crossover frequency and when there is low damping (phase lag close to \(-180^\circ\)).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Gain Crossover frequency is defined as the frequency \(\omega_{gc}\) at which $$</td>
          <td>L(j\omega)</td>
          <td>=1$$</td>
        </tr>

  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Time delay and Non-minimum phase place a <strong>fundamental limit</strong> on how small max(</td>
          <td>S</td>
          <td>) can be! This is a hard rule that needs to be satisfied. One can shift $$</td>
          <td>omega_{gc}$$ to the left, which means the system can only track lowfrequency references and reject lower frequency disturbances.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Peaks in Sensitivity Plots are directly correlated with Gain and Phase Margins. The smaller the margins, the bigger the peak.</p>

<h2 id="loop-shaping-tips">Loop shaping Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Loop shaping is a technique that tries to shape the <strong>Open Loop Transfer Function</strong> \(L(s)\), according to the desired shape - an <strong>integrator</strong>. The Transfer Function on the bode plot can be shifted left or right by multiplying \(L(s)\) with \(\omega_{s}\) to change the gain at low and high frequencies.</li>
