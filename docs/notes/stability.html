<h2 id="stability-margins---gain-and-phase-margins">Stability Margins - Gain and Phase Margins</h2>
<p>In simple terms, Gain and Phase margins are the safe net and the extra that protects us from instability.
less margin = less stable</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
<em>Gain</em> crossover frequency is used to caluclate <em>Phase</em> Margin.</p>

<p><em>Phase</em> crossover frequency is used to caculate <em>Gain</em> Margin.</p>

<p>The Gain and PhaseMargins are <strong>defined with respect to open-loop transfer function</strong>, but the margins are not intrinsic properties of the open-loop system alone, and are only meaningful for the corresponding closed-loop system.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="gain-margin">Gain Margin</h3>

<p>The gain margin (GM) is defined at the phase crossover frequency 
\(\omega_{pc}  \text{ where } \angle L(j\omega_{pc}) = -180^\circ\):</p>

\[GM = \frac{1}{|L(j\omega_{pc})|}\]

<p>In decibels (dB):</p>

\[GM_{\text{dB}} = -20 \log_{10} |L(j\omega_{pc})|\]

<p>If there are multiple <strong>Phase crossover frequencies \(\omega_{pc}\)</strong>, use the most conservative Gain Margin.</p>

<h3 id="phase-margin">Phase Margin</h3>

<p>The phase margin (PM) is defined at the gain crossover frequency 
\(\omega_{gc}\) where \(|L(j\omega_{gc})| = 1\):</p>

\[PM = 180^\circ + \angle L(j\omega_{gc})\]

<h3 id="margins-and-sensitivity">Margins and Sensitivity</h3>

<p>Peaks in Sensitivity Plots are directly correlated with Gain and Phase Margins. The smaller the margins, the bigger the peak.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="closed-loop-stability">Closed Loop Stability</h2>

<p>In a non-unity feedback system whose feedback transfer function is \(H(s)\), the closed loop transfer function is \(\frac{G(s)}{1+GH}\). We can study the stability of the closed loop transfer function by identifying the <strong>zeros</strong> of \(1+GH\).</p>

<p><strong>Adding 1 to the Nyquist plot of the open loop transfer function shift the plot to the right by 1</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="nyquist-criterion--bodenyquist-terms-unity-feedback">Nyquist Criterion — Bode/Nyquist Terms (Unity Feedback)</h2>

<p><strong>Setup.</strong> Let the open-loop transfer be \(G(s)\) for a unity-feedback loop with closed-loop characteristic \(1+G(s)=0\). Let:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(P\) = number of open-loop poles of \(G(s)\) in the right-half plane (RHP),</li>
  <li>\(N\) = number of <em>clockwise</em> encirclements of the Nyquist critical point \(-1+0j\) by the Nyquist plot of \(G(j\omega)\) (standard Nyquist contour),</li>
  <li>\(Z\) = number of closed-loop poles in the RHP.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Nyquist criterion.</strong>
\(Z = N + P.\)
The closed loop is <strong>stable</strong> iff \(Z=0\). Equivalently, the Nyquist plot must encircle \(-1\) <strong>clockwise</strong> exactly \(N=-P\) times.</p>

<p><strong>Common special case (open-loop stable, i.e., \(P=0\)).</strong>
If \(G(s)\) has no RHP poles and no poles on the \(j\omega\)-axis (aside from allowable integrators handled with the modified contour), then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closed loop is stable <strong>iff</strong> the Nyquist plot of \(G(j\omega)\) <strong>does not encircle</strong> \(-1+0j\) (i.e., \(N=0 \Rightarrow Z=0\)).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="bode-plot-restatements-margins">Bode-plot restatements (margins)</h3>

<p>Let \(\omega_{gc}\) be a gain-crossover frequency 
where \(|G(j\omega_{gc})|=1\), 
and let \(\omega_{pc}\) be a phase-crossover frequency
 where \(\angle G(j\omega_{pc})=-180^\circ\).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase margin condition (at gain crossover):</strong>
\(|G(j\omega_{gc})|=1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \angle G(j\omega_{gc}) &gt; -180^\circ\)
(positive phase margin). This ensures the Nyquist plot does <strong>not</strong> cross the real axis at or left of \(-1\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gain margin condition (at phase crossover):</strong>
\(\angle G(j\omega_{pc})=-180^\circ \quad \Rightarrow \quad |G(j\omega_{pc})| &lt; 1\)
(positive gain margin). This keeps the Nyquist locus inside the unit circle when it is at \(-180^\circ\), avoiding the point \(-1\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If <strong>both</strong> conditions hold for all relevant crossovers and \(P=0\), the loop has positive stability margins and the closed loop is stable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="notescaveats">Notes/Caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If \(P&gt;0\) (open-loop unstable), you <strong>must</strong> have exactly \(N=-P\) clockwise encirclements of \(-1\). Simple “margin checks” at crossovers are insufficient without accounting for \(P\).</li>
  <li>Poles on the imaginary axis (e.g., pure integrators) require the standard indentation in the Nyquist contour; apply the modified criterion accordingly.</li>
  <li>The above statements presume unity feedback; for non-unity feedback, apply the criterion to the appropriate open-loop function that multiplies the feedback path.</li>
</ul>
