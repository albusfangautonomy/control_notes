  <li>
    <p>The stability of an LTI system depends solely on the poles of its transfer function, including stability, speed of decay/growth, or natural oscillaitons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zeros (roots of the numerator) don’t directly affect stability because they don’t appear in the characteristic equation that governs the natural modes of the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poles define how the system <em>naturally behaves</em> (transients, stability). Zeroes shape how the system reacts to inputs (modify transients, steady-state gain/phase, can cancel or distort modes)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-can-zeros-do">What can Zeros do?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Transient Shape and Overshoot
    <ul>
      <li>Zeros can introduce additional terms in the time response that can increase or decrease overshoot, depending on their location.</li>
      <li>A zero close to the origin (s = 0) or near the imaginary axis can significantly change the transient waveform.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Direction and Phase
    <ul>
      <li>Zeros affect the phase of the frequency response.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Magnitude Shaping
    <ul>
      <li>Zeros can boost or attenuate specific frequency components, affecting bandwidth and disturbance rejection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p>Where \(\mathcal{Z}\) is the damping ratio. \(\mathcal{Z}=1\) means critically damped, \(\mathcal{Z}&lt;1\) means underdamped and \(\mathcal{Z}&gt;1\) means over damped.</p>

<p>The radial lines denote the lines of constant damping ratio \(\mathcal{Z}=cos(\phi)\), which defines a <strong>cone of damping ratio</strong> to satisfy design specs.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-root-locus-plot">What is a Root Locus Plot?</h3>
<p>root locus analysis is a graphical method for examining how the roots of a system change with variation of a certain system parameter, commonly a gain within a feedback system.</p>

<h2 id="10-rules-of-root-locus">10 Rules of Root Locus</h2>

<p>Setting the system up in this form: \(1 + K \frac{Q(s)}{P(s)}\)</p>

<p>let</p>

<p>n = number of poles of G(s) (also the number of loci), the open loop transfer function<br />
m = number of zeros of G(s)<br />
l = 0, 1, 2, 3… natural numbers<br />
q=order of repeated pole or zero<br />
\(\psi_{p} = \text{angle from a pole}\). Connect each pole with the pole/zero of interest, the angle between that line and positive x axis is \(\psi_p\) <br />
\(\psi_{z} = \text{angle from a zero}\). Connect each zero with the pole/zero of interest, the angle between that line and positive x axis is \(\psi_z\)</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1</strong>: There are <strong>n</strong> lines (loci), where \(n = max(deg(Q), deg(P))\)</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2</strong>: As K increases from 0 to \(\infty\), the closed loop poles move from the poles of open loop \(G(s)\) to the zeroes of open loop \(G(s)\)<br />
    - if there are same number of poles and zeroes, they form a pair the roots travel from one pole to a zero.<br />
    - if there are more Poles than Zeroes, the lines from the extra poles go to \(\infty\)<br />
    - if there are more Zeroes than Poles, the lines come from infinity to the extra zeroes</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3</strong>: When roots are complex, they occur in conjugate pairs and move together but mirrored across the real plane</p>

<p><strong>Rule 4</strong>: At no time will the same root cross over its path<br />
    - Paths of other roots may cross each other</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5</strong>: The portion of the real axis to the left of an odd number of open loop poles and zeroes are part of the loci<br />
    - Another way to restate: For K&gt;0, loci exist on the real axis to the left of odd numbered poles and zeroes</p>

<p><strong>Rule 6</strong>: Lines leave and enter the real axis at \(90^\circ\).</p>

<p><strong>Rule 7</strong>: If there are not enough poles or zeroes to make a pair then the extra lines go to (for poles) or come from (for zeroes) infinity.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 8</strong>: Line go to infinity along asymptotes <br />
    - The angles of the asymptotes, \(\phi_{A} = \frac{(2l+1)}{n - m} * 180^\circ\)<br />
    - Asymptotes intercept the real axis at \(\sigma_{0}\) (ie. centroid of the asymptotes), \(\sigma = \frac{\Sigma \text{finite poles} - \Sigma \text{finite zeroes}}{n - m}\)<br />
    - <strong>Angle of departure</strong> from a pole: \(\frac{1}{q}(\Sigma(\psi_z)-\Sigma(\psi_p)-180-360l)\)</p>

<p><strong>Rule 9</strong>: If there are at least two lines to infinity, then the sum of all roots is constant</p>

<p><strong>Rule 10</strong>: K going from 0 to \(-\infty\) can be drawn by reversing rule 5 and adding \(180^\circ\) to the asymptote angles.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="more-details-on-the-10-rules">More details on the 10 rules</h3>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> \(P(s) +KQ(s) = 0\) by re-arranging the terms. When K = 0, P(s) = 0, which is the definition of poles for G(s). As K increases, more emphasis is put on Q(s)</p>
