  <h1 id="open-loop-vs-closed-loop-control">Open Loop vs Closed Loop Control</h1>
<p>Why feedback control?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Uncertainty (inherent in the system) in open loop system dynamics. Preplanned control inputs may fall flat against uncertainties.</li>
  <li>Instability of the open loop system cann never be dealt with by open loop control. Feedback control allows us to directly change the dynamics of the system, inlcuding the eigenvalues of the system.</li>
  <li>Disturbances (external forces) can be rejected by feedback.</li>
  <li>Energy and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>\(\dot{x}=Ax + Bu\), \(y=Cx\), let \(u=-Kx\), \(\dot{x}=Ax-BKx=(A-BK)x\)
<br />
We are able to change the actual dynamics of the system to stabilize it by selecting appropriate \(B*K\).</p>

<h1 id="why-is-open-loop-transfer-functions-important">Why is Open Loop Transfer Functions Important</h1>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Closed-loop stability depends on open-loop behavior</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The closed-loop characteristic equation is:
 \(1+L(s)=0\)
 where \(L(s)\) is the open-loop transfer function.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All the closed-loop poles (which determine stability) come from this equation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If \(L(s)\) has certain properties (like unstable poles or bad phase margins), the closed loop can become unstable.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open Loop Transfer Functions reveal robustness by Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity
    <ul>
      <li>The closer the Open Loop Transfer Function L gets to -I, the bigger Sensitivity gets, and the less stable the system gets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
